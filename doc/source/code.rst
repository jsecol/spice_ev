Code documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below, the scripts and modules of SpiceEV are explained. The structure of the documentation follows the one from the
GitHub repository.

.. _generate:

Generate
========
The `generate` script and corresponding :ref:`generate modules <generate_modules>` prepare input files for the
simulation with SpiceEV. For an example configuration file see `/examples/configs/generate.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: generate
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    update_namespace
    generate

.. _generate_schedule:

Generate schedule
=================
The `generate_schedule` script, together with the :ref:`generate_schedule module <generate_schedule_module>`, generates
a CSV file containing a schedule from the grid operator containing grid signals. The path to the CSV file is also added
to an existing `scenario.json`. For an example configuration file see `/examples/configs/generate_schedule.cfg`.

Simulate
========
The `simulate` script reads in the simulation input arguments, sets up the scenario and runs the simulation. It serves as a
wrapper for the simulation. For an example configuration file see `/examples/configs/simulate.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: simulate
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    simulate

Calculate costs
===============
The `calculate costs` script calculates the electricity costs based on the price sheet of the respective distribution
grid operator. The calculation can be done during the simulation or independently afterwards. For the latter case a
configuration file is needed. For an example see `/examples/configs/calculate_costs.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: calculate_costs
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    read_simulation_csv

spice_ev
========

The `spice_ev` folder contains the modules called by the scripts above.

.. _generate_modules:

Generate
--------

Depending on the mode selected in the `generate.cfg` one of the following modules is called by the `generate.py`.

Generate_from_csv
.................
This module generates a `scenario.json` from a CSV file with a rotation schedule of the vehicle fleet. For an example
configuration file see `/examples/configs/generate_from_csv.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.generate.generate_from_csv
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    generate_from_csv
    csv_to_dict
    assign_vehicle_id

Generate_from_statistics
........................
This module generates a `scenario.json` with random dummy trips for a set up defined by the input
arguments. For an example configuration file see `/examples/generate_from_statistics.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.generate.generate_from_statistics
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    datetime_from_string
    generate_trip
    generate_from_statistics

Generate_from_simbev
....................
This module generates a `scenario.json` from SimBEV [#]_ results. For an example
configuration file see `/examples/configs/generate_from_simbev.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.generate.generate_from_simbev
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    parse_vehicle_types
    generate_from_simbev

.. _generate_schedule_module:

Generate_schedule
.................

This module generates a schedule with grid signals needed by some charging strategies and incentive schemes. For an
example configuration file see `/examples/configs/generate_schedule.cfg`.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.generate.generate_schedule
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    generate_flex_band
	generate_individual_flex_band
    generate_schedule

Strategies
----------

Different strategies can be applied on the vehicle fleet. For more information on the strategies see section
:ref:`Charging strategies <charging_strategies>`. Depending on the strategy selected in the `simulate.cfg` one of the
following modules is called by the `simulate.py`.

Balanced
........
Each vehicle is charged such that it uses its complete standing time to reach the
desired state of charge (SOC). May charge more power (and above the desired SOC) if there is
surplus from local generation or if the energy price falls below a certain PRICE_THRESHOLD.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.strategies.balanced
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    Balanced
    Balanced.step

Balanced Market
...............
When using this strategy, price information within the next *HORIZON* hours is evaluated. The goal is to divide standing
times into periods of equal prices. A vehicle is now charged such that is uses the entire duration of all periods with
the lowest price combined to reach its desired SOC. In case that time is not sufficient the periods of the second cheapest
price are used to charge as much of the remaining delta SOC as possible, again in a balanced way with respect to power.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.strategies.balanced_market
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    BalancedMarket
    BalancedMarket.step

Distributed
...........
Unlimited grid connectors (GCs) are supported. Vehicles that arrive at a charging station with opportunity charging are
charged with strategy `greedy`, those arriving at a depot station are charged with strategy `balanced`. Possible use
cases are bus scenarios.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.strategies.distributed
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    Distributed
    Distributed.step

Flex window
...........

An attempt is made to charge the vehicles mainly in time windows during which charging is encouraged by the grid
operator. During these time windows the vehicles are charged with a sub-strategy that can be selected in the
`simulate.cfg`

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.strategies.flex_window
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    FlexWindow

    FlexWindow.distribute_peak_shaving_batteries
    FlexWindow.distribute_peak_shaving_v2g
    FlexWindow.distribute_power
    FlexWindow.load_surplus_to_batteries

Greedy
......
With this strategy one vehicle after the other is charged with full power until the desired SOC is reached. Depending on
the maximum permitted power at the GC, multiple vehicles may be charged in one timestep.

.. currentmodule:: spice_ev.strategies.greedy
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    Greedy
    Greedy.step


Peak shaving
................
This strategy aims to flatten power peaks by drawing power in times of low load and supporting grid connectors (e.g. with a stationary battery) in times of high load.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/

    PeakShaving

Peak load window
................

are supported.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: temp/
